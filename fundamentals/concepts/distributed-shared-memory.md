# Distributed Shared Memory

### **Overview**

**Distributed Shared Memory (DSM)** is an abstraction in distributed computing that enables a collection of networked computers (nodes) to **share memory** as if they were part of a single physical memory system. DSM systems provide a shared address space across multiple machines, allowing processes on different nodes to **communicate and coordinate** by reading and writing shared variables, without needing explicit message passing.

DSM simplifies programming for distributed systems by **mimicking the semantics of shared memory** found in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems, even though the underlying hardware is physically distributed.

***

### **Purpose and Benefits**

* **Transparency:** Hides the complexities of data communication over the network.
* **Ease of programming:** Allows developers to use familiar shared-memory constructs like variables and pointers.
* **Portability:** Applications written for shared-memory architectures can be adapted more easily to run on distributed systems.
* **Cost-efficiency:** Leverages commodity hardware rather than expensive, tightly coupled multiprocessors.

***

### **Key Concepts**

#### **1. Shared Address Space**

* Processes see a **single logical memory space**, even though the actual memory is physically distributed.
* Each process can read and write to any location in the shared space.

#### **2. Memory Consistency Models**

DSM systems use different models to define **when updates to shared data become visible** to other processes.

* **Strict Consistency:** Any read returns the most recent write (very costly in distributed systems).
* **Sequential Consistency:** Operations appear to execute in some global order.
* **Causal Consistency:** Writes that are causally related must be seen in order.
* **Weak and Release Consistency:** Allow more flexibility and better performance by delaying synchronization.

#### **3. Granularity**

* The size of memory units managed in DSM (e.g., words, pages, or objects).
* **Page-based DSM:** Memory is divided into pages (similar to virtual memory systems).
* **Object-based DSM:** Memory is organized around data objects rather than fixed-size blocks.

### **Implementation Techniques**

#### **1. Software DSM**

* Built entirely in software, typically on top of existing operating systems.
* No special hardware is required.
* Examples: TreadMarks, Munin

#### **2. Hardware DSM**

* Implemented using special hardware mechanisms for memory access and coherence.
* More expensive and complex, often used in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.

### **Data Coherence and Synchronization**

To ensure **data coherence**, DSM systems use protocols for:

* **Invalidation:** Invalidate other copies when one node writes to a variable.
* **Update:** Propagate changes to all copies.

**Synchronization primitives** like **locks, barriers, and semaphores** are used to coordinate access to shared memory and avoid race conditions.

***

### **Design Challenges**

* **Latency:** Network delays can degrade performance compared to local memory.
* **False Sharing:** Occurs when unrelated variables share the same memory block or page, leading to unnecessary data transfers.
* **Scalability:** Maintaining consistency and synchronization becomes harder as the number of nodes increases.
* **Fault Tolerance:** A node failure can corrupt the shared memory unless fault-tolerant mechanisms are in place.

***

### **Use Cases**

* **Parallel computing:** Enables fine-grained parallelism across distributed nodes.
* **Cluster-based applications:** Provides shared memory semantics for applications running on compute clusters.
* **Distributed databases and in-memory data grids:** Improves performance by replicating and sharing memory across nodes.

***

### **Examples of DSM Systems**

* **TreadMarks:** A well-known software DSM system using lazy release consistency.
* **Munin:** Focused on multiple consistency models for different access patterns.
* **Mirage:** A system supporting heterogeneous memory and software interfaces.
* **Orca:** An object-based DSM system with support for data-parallel computations.

### **Comparison with Other Models**

| Feature                  | DSM                                                                | Message Passing                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Communication style      | Implicit (shared variables)                                        | Explicit (send/receive)          |
| Programming complexity   | Easier, more intuitive                                             | More control, but complex        |
| Performance              | Lower for small-scale, may suffer from coherence overhead at scale | Often better scalability         |
| Debugging and monitoring | Harder due to implicit state                                       | Easier due to clear message flow |

### **Conclusion**

Distributed Shared Memory bridges the gap between **shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures**, making it easier to develop parallel and distributed applications. While DSM introduces complexities in performance tuning and consistency management, it greatly enhances **programmability and abstraction** for distributed systems.
