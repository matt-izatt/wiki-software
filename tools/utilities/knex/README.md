# Knex

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/knex.png)

Knex is a "batteries included" SQL query builder designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use. I works with:

* **Postgres**
* **MSSQL**
* **MySQL**
* **MariaDB**
* **SQLite3**
* **Oracle**
* **Amazon Redshift**

It features both traditional node style [callbacks](https://knexjs.org/#Interfaces-Callbacks) as well as a [promise](https://knexjs.org/#Interfaces-Promises) interface for cleaner async flow control, a [stream](https://knexjs.org/#Interfaces-Streams) interface, full-featured [query](https://knexjs.org/#Builder) and [schema](https://knexjs.org/#Schema) builders, [transaction **** ](https://knexjs.org/#Transactions)support**,** connection pooling and standardised responses between different query clients and dialects.
